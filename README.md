# CO2-electrolyzer-model
This repository contains a semi-empirical CO2 electrolyzer model. 
"ElectrolyzerACM.acmf" is the model provided in Aspen Custom Modeler file (ACM) format. ElectrolyzerACM is complete with stream connections and a component list imported from Aspen Plus. This file can be packaged for use in Aspen Plus/HYSYS. "ElectrolyzerCode" is the electrolyzer code implemented in the ACM file.

This model is from the following academic publication: Edwards, J. P. et al., "Pilot-Scale CO2 Electrolysis Enables a Semi-empirical Electrolyzer Model", ACS Energy Letters, 2023, 8, 2576-2584. Please cite this publication if you use the model.
